HELLO!
I'M LOOKING TO LEARN JS, CSS, HTML FOR A NEW CAREER.

THIS FIRST EXAMPLE USES MOSTLY JAVASCRIPT TO DRAW/BUILD A MOON LANDER WITH USER INPUT (RADIOS FOR NOW...)
MAKING THIS HAS HELPED ME WITH BASIC SYNTAX AND P5 LIBRARY KNOWLEDGE, AS WELL AS EXPLORING COLOR OPTIONS.
I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO RECREATE/REDESIGN THIS SHIP BUILDER WITH CSS TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THAT.

EVENTUALLY I WOULD LIKE TO PROGRAM A MOON LANDER GAME USING JAVASCRIPT AND CSS.
IDEALLY IT WOULD BE FUN TO BE ABLE TO IMPORT THE USER-DESIGNED SHIP INTO THE GAME,
EITHER WITH PRE-DESIGNED MODELS, OR USING THE BUILDER PAGE TO PASS THE SHAPES INTO THE GAME PAGE (BUT I'M NOT THERE YET)

ANY FEEDBACK, SUGGESTIONS, OR COMMENTS ARE WELCOME. THANK YOU!
